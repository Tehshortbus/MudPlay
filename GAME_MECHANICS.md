# Game Mechanics Reference — MajorMUD / MegaMUD

How the game engine actually behaves and what messages it emits. This is the trusted record
so a session doesn't re-guess engine behavior — **read it before reasoning about the game, and
append to it when the user confirms something new.** Per CLAUDE.md: never invent a mechanic; if
it isn't here and you're unsure, ask.

**Confidence tags**
- **[CONFIRMED]** — the user confirmed it directly.
- **[OBSERVED]** — grounded in the client's own parsers / message handling or a real
  bug-report capture; strongly evidenced but not explicitly user-confirmed.
- **[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]** — the code currently relies on it, but it's unverified; ask before
  extending anything that depends on it.

## Equipment & gear

**Equip / remove verbs** *(all [CONFIRMED])*
- `eq <item>` — the universal equip verb; works for **every** slot (armor *and* weapons).
- `wear <item>` — alternative for **armor** items only.
- `wield <item>` — alternative for **weapons** only.
- `rem <item>` — the universal remove verb; removes any equipped item (armor, weapon, or light).
- `hold` — **not used** by this game.

**Trade-places on equip** *([CONFIRMED])*
- If a slot is occupied and you `eq` (or `use`, for a light) another item from your inventory,
  the new item **trades places** with the current one — the old item returns to inventory —
  **provided the new item is actually usable** (class/level/slot constraints, a two-hander vs
  an occupied off-hand, etc.). If it isn't usable, the swap fails and nothing changes. So a
  single-slot swap needs no explicit `rem` first.

**Other**
- **[CONFIRMED]** No effect in the game force-unequips gear (no disarm / removal effects).
  Worn state changes *only* from commands the player or the client issues.
- **[OBSERVED]** A two-handed weapon needs both hands free; the game rejects the wield while an
  off-hand is occupied (it isn't "usable" until the off-hand is gone), so the off-hand must be
  `rem`'d first.
- **[OBSERVED]** Re-equipping an item that's already worn draws
  `You do not have <X> left unequipped.`

## Light sources

- **[CONFIRMED]** `use <item>` readies a light (torch, lantern); `rem <item>` removes it.
  Lights follow the same trade-places rule as `eq` — `use`-ing a new light swaps out the
  current one (if usable).

## Items & acquisition

- **[CONFIRMED]** Items are acquired via `buy` / `get` / `search`+`get`. There is no "hunt"
  verb — don't describe path-item sourcing as "hunting."

## Party

- **[CONFIRMED]** Party size: minimum 2, maximum 6.
- **[CONFIRMED]** Leader disconnect disbands the whole party — no grace-window auto-invite for
  a dropped leader.

## Talk / chat

- **[CONFIRMED]** Talk modes (say / talk-fast / slow) differ **per realm** — that's game
  configuration, not a client bug. The keyboard period is a say-precursor and stays unbindable.

## Message catalogue (lines the client parses)

| Event | Line |
|---|---|
| Wear (names no slot) | `You are now wearing <X>.` |
| Remove | `You have removed <X>.` |
| Weapon swap (two lines) | `You removed <old>.` then `You are now wearing <new>.` |
| Already worn | `You do not have <X> left unequipped.` |
